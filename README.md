Current components:

`i3-wm`
`tmux`
`vim`

Workspace
---------

1. Normalize tmux panes and i3 windows so that movement is streamlined.
2. Maybe normalize vim panes, though I don't use split vim windows.
3. Turn off wrap around
4. Allow workspace metadata. Currently use this to set a name per i3 workspace.
   This is used to key the automatic tmux session that are generated per
   terminal instance.
